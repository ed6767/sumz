# sumz
Really bad bot for Scratch that takes a list of users and follows them real fast. Used on @TheBestProfile circa 2017

EDX Scratch User Mods Tool

Beta build 1
What is it?
The scratch user mod tool allows some mods to the scratch website, like building reports on people or using views and follow bots to get attention.

A follow bot? What do you mean?
A Follow bot is an application that follows a large amount of people from a list in order to get followers through Follow4Follow. The concept of follow bots have been around since the dawn of social media. Technically, follow bots are against the Community Guidelines as it's tricking the community.
EDX SUMZ is the first follow bot ever on scratch.

Does it really work?
Yes!
